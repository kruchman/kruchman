My name is Iurii, Im from Russia, Saint-Petersburg. Commenced independent study of the Swift programming language in October 2022. I pursued learning primarily through books, courses, and a variety of other freely available resources that I could find. Starting from the spring of 2023, I began building my portfolio by creating various small-scale applications using different frameworks. This was aimed at gaining practical experience and reinforcing the knowledge I had acquired. I consistently upload all of my projects to my GitHub repository.

- [TheGamerApp](https://github.com/kruchman/TheGamerApp): "Something like a social network for players. The application implements the ability to register and login, chat with sending and receiving messages, the ability to create and edit your profile, as well as see the profiles of other players with the ability to start a new chat with them, as well as add them to favorites. When creating this application I resorted to the use of third-party library Firebase, to such tools as Firebase Auth, Firebase Firestore, Firebase Storage "
