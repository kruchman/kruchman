My name is Iurii, Im from Russia, Saint-Petersburg. Commenced independent study of the Swift programming language in October 2022. I pursued learning primarily through books, courses, and a variety of other freely available resources that I could find. Starting from the spring of 2023, I began building my portfolio by creating various small-scale applications using different frameworks. This was aimed at gaining practical experience and reinforcing the knowledge I had acquired. I consistently upload all of my projects to my GitHub repository.
